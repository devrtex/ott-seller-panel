## Add User: Quickly add new users to your system
Easily add new users to your system and streamline the onboarding process. To make it even more convenient, we've integrated a link shortener feature using the TinyURL API. This feature shortens the provider ID link, making it easier to key in for OTT providers.
### How it works:
1. Generate the provider ID link.
2. Utilize the integrated TinyURL API to shorten the link.
3. Share the shortened link with the OTT provider for seamless registration.
With this feature, adding users to your system is faster and more efficient than ever before!
