## Add User: Quickly add new users to your system
Easily add new users to your system and streamline the onboarding process. To make it even more convenient, we've integrated a link shortener feature using the TinyURL API. This feature shortens the provider ID link, making it easier to key in for OTT providers.

### How it works:
1. Generate the provider ID link.
